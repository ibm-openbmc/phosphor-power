/**
 * @class UPS
 *
 * This class represents an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) device.
 *
 * The UPS must be connected to the system using an IBM System Port Converter
 * Cable.  This USB cable allows for communications from a UPS relay interface
 * card to a BMC USB port.
 *
 * The UPS status is read from the USB cable.  The status is published on D-Bus
 * using the UPower Device interface.
 *
 * The PLDM application uses the D-Bus information to build PLDM state sensors.
 * These state sensors communicate the UPS status to the host operating system.
 *
 * If a UPS is not connected to the system, the IsPresent property of the D-Bus
 * interface is set to false.  The D-Bus object for the UPS always exists.  This
 * is required due to the way PLDM maps the D-Bus interface properties into PLDM
 * state sensors.
